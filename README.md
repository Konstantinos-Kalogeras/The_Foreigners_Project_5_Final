This repository was developed by Konstantinos Kalogeras, Om Patel, Austin Trinh, and Yoseph Hassan.

This repository intends to display the work and code that we have written for project 5 in Prof. Rafael's class ENGIN 480

We did not include the pkl files with the optimization converging in this repository because of potential bugs that could happen, which would prevent us from pushing the code
